# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

The repository is about lab homework of AI and Machine Learning, in which we use numpy to write many classical machine learning models.

## hw2
Homework 2 is linear regression. Considering MSE loss, using SGD, BGD and MBGD, with min-max normalization and mean normalization, we test the linear regression model with self defined dataset. For all those methods above, we analyze the difference of each choice.

The code is in [hw2.py](https://github.com/Wendy-Ying/AI-and-Machine-Learning-Lab/blob/main/hw2.py), and the report is in [hw2.pdf](https://github.com/Wendy-Ying/AI-and-Machine-Learning-Lab/blob/main/%E4%BA%BA%E5%B7%A5%E6%99%BA%E8%83%BD%E4%B8%8E%E6%9C%BA%E5%99%A8%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0hw2.pdf).

## hw3
Homework 3 is perceptron. It use the wine dataset (each wine sample with a class label and 13 features, which are chemical indicators such as alcohol content and malic acid concentration). We randomly choose two class of the wine dataset, and use BGD and SGD to train the perceptron. After training, we use accuracy, precision, recall and f1 score to evaluate the model.

The code is in [hw3.py](https://github.com/Wendy-Ying/AI-and-Machine-Learning-Lab/blob/main/hw3.py), and the report is in [hw3.pdf](https://github.com/Wendy-Ying/AI-and-Machine-Learning-Lab/blob/main/%E4%BA%BA%E5%B7%A5%E6%99%BA%E8%83%BD%E4%B8%8E%E6%9C%BA%E5%99%A8%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0hw3.pdf).

## hw4
Homework 4 is logistic regression. Also using the wine dataset, use MBGD and SGD to train the model. Use accuracy, precision, recall and f1 score to evaluate the model.

The code is in [hw4.py](https://github.com/Wendy-Ying/AI-and-Machine-Learning-Lab/blob/main/hw4.py), and the report is in [hw4.pdf](https://github.com/Wendy-Ying/AI-and-Machine-Learning-Lab/blob/main/%E4%BA%BA%E5%B7%A5%E6%99%BA%E8%83%BD%E4%B8%8E%E6%9C%BA%E5%99%A8%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0hw4.pdf).

## hw5
Homework 5 is multi-layer perceptron. It use numpy to develop MLP model, with SGD and MBGD update method. Also, there's cross validation and early stopping, to automatically increase the size of the layer. The model is tested by classification problem and nonlinear regression problem, and both of them have perfect performance.

The code is in [hw5.py](https://github.com/Wendy-Ying/AI-and-Machine-Learning-Lab/blob/main/hw5.py), and the report is in [hw5.pdf](https://github.com/Wendy-Ying/AI-and-Machine-Learning-Lab/blob/main/%E4%BA%BA%E5%B7%A5%E6%99%BA%E8%83%BD%E4%B8%8E%E6%9C%BA%E5%99%A8%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0hw5.pdf).

## hw6
Homework 6 is k-nearest neighbour. Realized by numpy, the model has perfect performance with Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

The code is in [hw6.py](https://github.com/Wendy-Ying/AI-and-Machine-Learning-Lab/blob/main/hw6.py), and the report is in [hw6.pdf](https://github.com/Wendy-Ying/AI-and-Machine-Learning-Lab/blob/main/%E4%BA%BA%E5%B7%A5%E6%99%BA%E8%83%BD%E4%B8%8E%E6%9C%BA%E5%99%A8%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0hw6.pdf).
